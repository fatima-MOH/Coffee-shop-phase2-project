### About the Project: 📚
The project is a simple react coffee shop project in which you can add a coffee type by using an image description and a price to each coffee item.It was created to meet the project's phase 2 requirements, which are as follows:

1. You must make a single page application (only one index.html
file) using create-react-app.

2. Your app should use at least 5 components in a way that keeps
your code well organized.

3. There should be at least 3 client-side routes using React
Router. Be sure to include a nav bar or other UI element that
allows users to navigate between routes.

4. Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and
make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. Use a
form to make your post request, specifically a controlled
form/component. Additionally, you may choose to incorporate
data from an external API but it is not required.

5. Add some styling: you're encouraged to write your CSS from
scratch, either by using styled components or writing CSS
files and using id/className to style your elements. You can
also incorporate a UI framework (like React Bootstrap,
Semantic UI, or Material UI) if you prefer.
